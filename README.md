# Cover Crop image Classifier 
This Repository houses the data and code for a Machine Learning model that classifies species of cover crops using Tensor Flow.


The repository will be updated in consistency with the progress made to the neural network model. 


# Tools used for Development 
This Machine Learning model will be designed using a standard Python local environmnet as well as on Google Colab. Google Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup, and runs entirely on the Cloud. Colab has tensorflows API's entirely integrated and is useful in applying Tensorflows GPU abilites.

Both versions of the model will be provided and updated in this repository.
